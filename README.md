# GHR-MGMT
Ever wanted to garbage-collect your musty collection of GitHub repos, without the hassle of typing, and re-typing (!), their names into the official browser interface? Thanks to the first in a series of small, absurdly useful JavaScript applications over the next ten business days, NOW YOU CAN!!!

## Use
1. Authorize GHR-MGMT to your GitHub account
2. Select unsightly, atrophied, juvenile, or cobweb-riddent repos from the list. Go ahead, choose as many as you like.
3. Hit the delete button.
4. Yeah, you made the internet a tidy place!
